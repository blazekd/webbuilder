# Webbuilder

This is webbuilder inspired mostly by [Webnode](webnode.cz) and [Squarespace](squarespace.com). You can create webpage and then export it to JSON or HTML. You can also import exported JSON back. The Worlds Collide default webpage is re-creation of one default pages from Webnode.   

Uploading and retrieving of images is done using simple PHP API found in `src/api`.
